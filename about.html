                    <h2>Our Story</h2>
                    <p>The Grand Elm began its journey in 1892 as the magnificent estate of the prestigious Elmwood family. Originally built as a summer retreat, this architectural gem has witnessed over a century of celebrations, from intimate family gatherings to grand society events.</p>
                    <p>In 2015, after years of careful restoration and modernization, The Grand Elm opened its doors as a premier event venue. Our restoration team worked tirelessly to preserve the building's historic character while adding modern amenities that today's events demand.</p>
                    <p>Today, The Grand Elm stands as a testament to timeless elegance, offering the perfect blend of historic charm and contemporary luxury. Every corner of our venue tells a story, and we invite you to become part of our continuing legacy.</p>
